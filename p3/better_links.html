                    On Sunday the 3th of December the polar night started here and I
                    started to write this blog about the polar night <a
                    href='https://norwaytravelguide.no/norwegian-nature/polar-nights-norway'>and
                    what it is</a>. But as it goes during this time of darkness,
                    time slows down and eventually stops during the Christmas
                    holidays.

                    So the blog was never finished, but last week daylight came back
                    and energy started to flow again, bringing everything back to
                    life. And now we desperately wait for the sun to show itself.
                    From the beginning of November the sun was leaving us, pulling
                    away higher and higher into the mountains. But when the polar
                    night started we did not exactly notice a difference from the
                    day before, because it had been clouded a couple of days.

                    In my car my sunglasses still remind me of the sun warming my
                    face and blinding my view. During snow and rain I automatically
                    use the back window wiper only to see the pitch dark in the rear
                    mirror. More and more I forget to use <a
                    href='https://norway.nordicvisitor.com/travel-guide/information/driving-in-norway/'>the
                    mirrors driving in the dark mountains</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That the sun doesn’t rise doesn’t mean it is pitch dark the
                    whole time, as many people think in <a
                    href='https://www.lifeinnorway.net/the-five-seasons-of-norway/'>the
                    darkest dates (mørketiden)</a>. There are still some hours of
                    twilight as a remembrance of the day, sunset and sunrise going
                    over in each other colouring the sky in all kinds of delicate
                    pastel colours – from yellow to orange, pink and red. Especially
                    visible on cold, ‘sunny’ days. There is something very special
                    about this dark time, like everything we learned and know isn’t
                    totally truth anymore.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Like the sun doesn’t come up tomorrow; there is no sun shining
                    behind the clouds etc. This makes one wonder what reality is,
                    ponder over what we are. Spirituality becomes a natural
                    reaction. Our conditioned behaviour doesn’t work either, with
                    the day rhythm disturbed by the lack of light. The same goes for
                    the summer with <a
                    href='https://www.visitnorway.com/things-to-do/nature-attractions/midnight-sun/top-places-to-see-the-midnight-sun/'>its
                    midnight sun</a>. The insomnia that is known during the white
                    nights in the summer is actually worse in the winter; the body
                    doesn’t know when to go asleep without the sunlight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A lot of the nights are decorated by the intriguing, <a
                    href='https://capturetheatlas.com/see-the-northern-lights-in-norway/'>beautiful
                    Northern Lights</a>, making it hard to go to bed anyway! To
                    survive this though time people celebrate Christmas intensively
                    from the end of November with lots of Christmas decorations
                    (especially a lot of lights around the house) and <a
                    href='https://sayhitonorway.com/2015/12/11/the-tradition-of-julebord-in-norway/'>traditional
                    julebord</a> (Christmas dinners).
                </p>
                <p>
                    And even with all the tasks that have to be finished at work, we
                    can always find time for <a
                    href='https://nordnorge.com/?id=1159668009'>Christmas-activities</a>.
                    The Christmas holiday is a welcome and necessary break during
                    this dark and low energy period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today the sun itself still wasn’t visible on a <a
                    href='https://www.mountainhikingholidays.com/hiking-in-northern-norway-tromso-senja-lofoten/'>hiking
                    trip</a>, but at a given moment daylight suddenly appeared, the
                    tops of the mountains on the other site of the fjord were
                    glowing up and the snow under my feet was starting to show
                    shadows again. My body felt the warmth of the sun even without
                    its loving touch. Slowly the tension is building; who will send
                    the first sun picture to the local newspapers? Sun celebrations
                    are being planned everywhere and soon the kids in kindergarten
                    will celebrate standing outside in the sun eating ‘boller’ and
                    smiling like never before.

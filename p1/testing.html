            <blockquote> Hemingway published The old man and the Sea in 1952. The novel starts like this:</blockquote> <cite>“He was an
                old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now
                without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days
                without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally
                salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat
                which caught three good fish the first week.”</cite>
